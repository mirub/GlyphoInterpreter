Project description:
    The current program represents a Glypho language interpreter. It reads
a string of characters from a file given as parameter and decodes and executes
certain instructions.
    The program begins by decoding the given instructions and then executes
them one by one. Its main functionality is based on a stack that keeps the
intermediary variables.

Files:
    main.py - The main file of the program, implements the basic functionality
              of the algorithm.

    functions.py -  Implements the helper functions for the main program:

                    read_file - Reads the commands from the given file
                    decode_instruc - Decodes the given instructions
                    check_braces - Verifies if the braces match
                    execute_instr - Executes the current instruction
                    deci_2_base - Transforms a decimal to a given base
                    check_base - Checks if the number can be in a given base
                    get_lbrace - Returns the corresponding l-brace

    operations.py - Implements the operations of the glypho program and checks
                    for errors.

Mentions: I get a timeout error for 2 tests on vmchecker but locally they pass
          just fine.
